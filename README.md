# base64-extracter
Extract image files from HTML with base64 encoded images
Takes a file titled sample.html and extracts all of the svg, png, and webp images that were base64 encoded inside that file and saves them as separate files inside the output/assets directory. A modified version of the html file is generated with the new paths added in place of the encoded images.
